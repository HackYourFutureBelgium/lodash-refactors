# Lodash Refactor

A few "simple" exercises to practice using NPM modules and Lodash.

### Instructions:
* clone this repo
* npm init
* install lodash
* complete the exercises!

### The Exercises:

There are several files in this directory.  Each one contains some code written using [Vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com).  Your task is write another line that does the exact same thing, but using [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15)!

This isn't as scary as it sounds.  With a little help from [You Might Not Need Lodash](https://youmightnotneed.com/lodash/) you'll even have fun.
